# Progress Tracker

Records the **state** of the build: what's done, what's in progress, and the
decisions made along the way. This file is the rear-view mirror.

Forward-looking, actionable steps do **not** live here — they live in
`Context/next-tasks.md`. Update this file after every meaningful change.

Last updated: 2026-06-10

## Current Phase

- **Auth + app shell LIVE on https://trackdco.app — verified in production
  (2026-06-08).** The full signup flow is deployed and working end-to-end:
  Continue-with-Google → `/auth/callback` code exchange → 18+/ToS gate at
  `/welcome` (DOB via Day/Month/Year dropdowns; server-side age check;
  all-three-docs consent) → guarded `(app)` shell + empty `/dashboard`, with
  sign-out and the root redirect. Proven with a real Google account
  (`admin@trackdco.app`): sign-in fired the `handle_new_user()` trigger, the gate
  wrote `date_of_birth`/`is_18_plus`/`tos_accepted_at`/`tos_version=0.2`, and
  sign-out + returning-user (skips the gate) both work. Prod checks pass: legal
  docs render from the DB, the PWA manifest serves, route guards redirect. The
  Data API works via the `api_role_grants` migration. **Remaining to fully close
  the 11 Jun checkpoint:** only publishing the Google OAuth app (currently in
  "Testing", so only listed Test users can sign in). The on-phone test (+ Add-to-
  Home-Screen install) and the two-account RLS isolation check are both **confirmed
  by both founders (2026-06-10)** — the PWA installs with the Trackd icon and opens
  full-screen, and each account saw only its own data. Backend, data model, seed
  catalogues, domain, and the public landing remain live.

## Completed

- **Profile glance unit-aware + PR #2 closed (2026-06-10).** The Profile tab's Physical
  glance now shows **Height/Weight in the user's preferred units** (cm/kg or in/lbs),
  mirroring the settings form — storage stays metric, converted for display only
  (`formatMeasure` in `app/(app)/profile/page.tsx`, reading `profiles.units_preference`).
  **PR #2 was CLOSED — not merged** (via the GitHub API using the osxkeychain git
  credential, since `gh` isn't authed), with a comment explaining the settings feature was
  landed directly on `main`. The stale `feat/settings` branch can still be deleted.

- **Settings landed on `main` + Profile/Settings page fade + prod deploy (2026-06-10).**
  Lifted the 3 self-contained **Settings** files (`app/(app)/settings/{page,actions}.tsx`,
  `components/settings/settings-form.tsx`) directly onto `main` from the **stale
  `feat/settings`** branch — that branch had fallen far behind `main` (it predated the new
  Profile page, Adrian's gradient wordmark, the brand scripts, and the PWA cold-launch
  fixes), so merging the whole branch would have **reverted** that work. Only the feature
  files were cherry-picked (every import already resolves on `main`). `/settings` (read-only
  account block + server-validated, RLS-scoped editable sex/height/goal/units) is now live,
  so the Profile tab's Settings links resolve instead of 404ing. Added a **subtle fade-up
  entrance** (`animate-in fade-in-0 slide-in-from-bottom-2 duration-500 ease-out` +
  `motion-reduce:animate-none`) to both the Profile and Settings page roots via the
  already-imported `tw-animate-css` — no shared-file change. Pushed to `main` → deployed to
  prod (trackdco.app); `tsc` + `lint` + prod `build` clean; route table shows `/profile` +
  `/settings`. **Follow-up (2026-06-10):** Settings gained a **Weight (kg)** field
  (validated 30–300 to match the schema CHECK; placeholder until the dedicated weight-
  tracking surface exists), and **Save now redirects to `/dashboard`** on success (via
  `redirect()` in the action; the inline "Saved." message was dropped). Height/Weight now
  display + accept the user's chosen **units** (cm/kg ↔ in/lbs) — imperial converts to metric
  on save (storage stays metric; the schema CHECKs validate the converted value; round-trip
  verified). **PR #2 is now
  superseded — CLOSE it (do NOT merge; the branch is behind `main` and would clobber it).**

- **Profile tab built — code complete, locally verified (2026-06-10).**
  `app/(app)/profile/page.tsx` (was a blank placeholder) is now the bottom-nav Profile
  destination: an identity/account **hub, NOT an editor** (edits route to `/settings`).
  Sections: identity hero (**code-point-safe initials avatar** — no external photo, since
  `next/image` has no `remotePatterns` — serif name, email, and a single amber **"Beta ·
  Pro" plan pill** = the one sanctioned amber accent); an **Account** card (member-since /
  plan / email); a **read-only Physical glance** (sex/age/height/weight/goal/units, "—"
  where unset, "Edit in Settings" hint); an **App** card linking Settings + the three legal
  docs (`/terms`·`/privacy`·`/medical-disclaimer`); and a bottom **sign-out**
  (`<form action={signOut}>`, alongside the header's). Server component; reads ONLY the
  user's own `profiles` row (RLS-scoped, `maybeSingle`, null-safe — defaults to Beta·Pro
  and renders "—" if the row is missing). **No schema / dependency / token / shared-file
  change.** Built via a **design-panel workflow** (3 diverse on-brand designs → synthesis)
  then a **5-dimension adversarial review** (correctness · RLS/security · a11y ·
  design-system · Next-16/React; 9 raw → 6 verified-real, all fixed): low-contrast
  `text-subtle` on the interactive Edit link + nav chevron → `text-muted`; a **negative-age
  guard** for a future/bad DOB (→ "—"); a proper **tap target** on the Edit link;
  **focus-visible amber rings** on every hand-rolled control (inset on the card rows to
  clear `overflow-hidden`); **code-point-safe initials**. Dismissed 3 (unreachable
  `fmtNum("")` under the `numeric(5,1)`+CHECK schema; the deliberate plan/email IA
  duplication). `tsc` + `npm run lint` + prod `npm run build` all clean; `/profile` builds
  as a server-rendered route. **Not yet PR'd** — visual QA + PR pending; `/settings` links
  404 until PR #2 merges (merge settings first). Open design-system note: `--text-muted`
  sits ~4:1 (just under AA 4.5:1) app-wide — a one-token call for Adrian, not changed here.

- **Brand wordmark → gradient logo images + launch-splash cleanup (2026-06-09).**
  Replaced the text wordmark ("trackd co", `co` in `--accent-amber`) with the real
  **transparent gradient PNG** (`public/trackd-wordmark.png`) everywhere it appeared
  at the small `text-lg` treatment — the `(app)` header, onboarding (`first-run`),
  `/welcome`, `/login`, `/preview`, and the legal-doc header — rendered via
  `next/image` at `h-5 w-auto`. The large `text-3xl` hero on the root landing
  (`app/page.tsx`) was deliberately **left as text** (distinct treatment). **iOS
  launch images regenerated** (`public/splash/apple-splash-*.png`) to show the short
  "Trackd" mark centred on the #111110 canvas with **no box** — fixes the faint dark
  square under the mark on launch. Source masters + a reproducible generator live in
  `scripts/brand/` (`node scripts/brand/generate.mjs`, uses `sharp`).

- **Bottom-of-screen "black bar" — reproduced + fix shipped (pending on-device check).**
  On cold launch the `fixed bottom-0` nav floats above the home indicator (a black
  strip below it) until the first swipe snaps it down — the iOS dynamic-viewport bug,
  reported in BOTH the installed PWA and Safari. Shipped a **visual-viewport pin** in
  `components/navigation/bottom-nav.tsx`: measure the gap between the visual-viewport
  bottom and the layout bottom and nudge the nav down by it on launch (re-measured via
  rAF + a 400ms settle + vv `resize`/`orientationchange`/`pageshow`; vv `scroll`
  deliberately skipped so overscroll can't jiggle it), **clamped to >= 0** so it can
  only move DOWN to the bottom, never up over content — worst case a no-op, so it can't
  regress. Keyboard-hide preserved (shares the single `transform`). `viewport-fit=cover`
  is confirmed served. **Unverified on-device:** Adrian can't test yet (Angus mid-auth),
  and the installed PWA serves stale cache (old splash persists) — needs a clean
  reinstall to even pick up the fix.

- **Plus-button "Shortcuts" menu built (Adrian's lane, 2026-06-09, PR `feat/shortcuts-menu`).**
  The bottom-nav centre plus now opens a styled **Shortcuts** bottom sheet instead of
  going straight to Add-to-Stack. Built from the spec
  (`Context/Feature Specs/03-shortcuts-control-creation.md`), then iterated with Adrian
  into a **two-tier layout** (his direction, drawing on a MacroFactor reference but kept
  entirely within `ui-context.md` tokens):
  - **Top tier — fixed circle quick-actions:** Log (Today's dose, `ListChecks` icon) ·
    Calculator (Reconstitution) · Journal · Calendar. Not reorderable.
  - **Bottom tier — full-width cards:** Weight (`Scale`) · Blood work · **Add a compound**
    (`Pill`). Add-a-compound defaults to the bottom but is reorderable like the others.
  - Centred sans (Geist) title; amber icon-strokes in tiles + circles (the sanctioned
    sparing amber use), warming on hover; the protected Add-to-Stack category dots are
    untouched and intact.

  **Only "Add a compound" is wired** — it presents the existing **Add-to-Stack flow
  completely unchanged** (reached by navigation, not rebuilt — the spec's "navigate to
  it" option, chosen so the protected flow stays untouched). Every other item opens one
  shared, non-functional `PlaceholderActionSheet` (passed title + a visual-only field
  that **saves nothing** + close; the **reconstitution calculator** also shows the
  medical-disclaimer warning).

  **Reorder (bottom cards only):** a small grey **pencil "Edit"** control top-right
  enters edit mode (replaced the original long-press trigger at Adrian's request); cards
  show a grip and drag up/down; **tap any shortcut, "Done", or dismiss commits** (tap-to-
  finish). Pointer-based, **no new dependency** (reuses the existing drag idiom; deliberate
  given the touch-PWA + flaky-npm note). Order persists per-device in `localStorage`
  (`trackd.shortcutOrder.<uid>`, **card ids only** — the single carve-out to the
  placeholders' no-persistence rule) and restores on open; the sheet's drag-to-dismiss is
  disabled during edit so the gestures can't fight.

  **Motion (professional, eased — no static cuts):** staggered fade-up **entrance** on
  open; a soft amber **tap "light-up" ripple** from the touch point on cards; the edit-
  mode hint **eases its height open/closed + fades** (which makes the cards + sheet rise/
  settle smoothly); **Edit ⇄ Done cross-fade**; chevron ⇄ grip fade. Keyframes live as
  plain classes in `app/globals.css` (`shortcut-in` / `shortcut-ripple` / `shortcut-fade`).

  New files: `components/shortcuts/{shortcutItems.ts, ShortcutItem.tsx,
  PlaceholderActionSheet.tsx, ShortcutsMenu.tsx}` + `lib/shortcutOrder.ts`;
  `components/navigation/bottom-nav.tsx` now renders `ShortcutsMenu`; `app/globals.css`
  gained the motion keyframes (shared-file change, Adrian-directed). No new
  tokens/colours/fonts, no schema/DB change. `tsc` + `npm run lint` clean; reviewed live
  via the dev-only `/preview` harness on localhost. Landed via the **PR flow** for
  CodeRabbit review (not a direct push).
- **Sydney region + honest PWA install + local toolchain (2026-06-09).** Moved the
  Vercel functions to **`syd1`** (new root `vercel.json` `{"regions":["syd1"]}`) to
  co-locate with the Sydney Supabase + the AU audience — warm app TTFB dropped from a
  steady **~330–480ms → ~210ms** (diagnosed by measurement: Supabase was always ~40ms
  = already Sydney; the lag was Vercel's `iad1`/US default). Resolves the "check
  region" backlog item. Recoloured the wordmark **"co" to amber** across all 7 spots.
  Rebuilt the **PWA install prompt** around what iOS actually allows — after two
  adversarially-verified research workflows (~60 sources) confirmed iOS has **no**
  programmatic Add-to-Home-Screen, `navigator.share()`'s sheet lacks the action
  (confirmed on Angus's phone), `app.link`/Branch is native-app deep-linking (not a
  PWA tool, not a push provider), and `.mobileconfig` profiles are worse + trust-toxic:
  removed the misleading share button, added **in-app-webview / non-Safari detection →
  "Open in Safari"** (rescues social-link traffic), iOS-26 "•••"-menu copy, and the
  "View More" step. Installed **`gh` + Vercel CLI** user-level (`~/.local/bin`);
  confirmed **`~/dev/trackd-co-app`** as the healthy off-iCloud canonical repo (all
  today's pushes ran from it, zero mmap errors). Detail in Session Notes 2026-06-09.
- **Add-to-Stack row controls + Radix import-bug fix (`feat/app-ui`, in the open PR
  to `main`, 2026-06-08).** Each **custom** compound's row now shows three
  right-aligned controls — a primary add-to-stack **+** (matches the catalogue rows;
  visual until the cycle feature lands), a smaller **edit** (opens the unchanged edit
  menu), and **delete** (same inline red confirm + per-user `localStorage` persistence
  as the edit menu); custom rows in search results get them too. Before that, fixed a
  **crash that took down the whole Add-to-Stack menu**: the earlier "code rabbit"
  commit (`42e08fb`) swapped the unified `radix-ui` dependency for the individual
  `@radix-ui/react-*` packages but left the `Dialog.Root` / `Slot.Root` namespace
  usage intact, so those resolved to `undefined` and every
  `sheet`/`dialog`/`tabs`/`scroll-area`/`button` threw "Element type is invalid" —
  fixed by switching the four wrappers to `import * as X` and `Button` to use `Slot`
  directly. `tsc` + `lint` + production build all clean. **Local dev unblocked:**
  restored the git-ignored `.env.local` (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` +
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`) — without it every Supabase-backed route
  500s locally (only `/preview`, which is outside the `(app)` auth shell, survives).
  Landing via a **PR** (CodeRabbit review) per the new flow, not a direct push.
- **Bottom nav + Add-to-Stack search (Adrian's lane, `feat/app-ui`, 2026-06-08).**
  Built the persistent **bottom navigation** (Home · Protocol · white **Plus** ·
  Progress · My Profile; route-driven amber/gray active state with a gray→amber
  fade; keyboard-aware hide; safe-area insets) and **integrated it into the merged
  auth shell** — rendered from `app/(app)/layout.tsx` with `userId` threaded in;
  Protocol/Progress/Profile placeholder pages added under `app/(app)/`; the Home tab
  points at Angus's real `/dashboard`. (Originally built under a parallel
  `app/(main)/` group on a pre-auth base; **reconciled onto current `main`** —
  dropped the duplicate `(main)` shell + placeholder dashboard to resolve the
  `/dashboard` collision with the auth lane.) The centre plus slides up the
  **Add to Stack** sheet (near-full-height card, drag-to-dismiss handle, Cancel +
  centred sans title). **Search is now wired to real data:** it filters the bundled
  **149-compound catalogue by name *and* aliases** (e.g. "deca"→Nandrolone
  Decanoate, "aromasin"→Exemestane, "npp"→Nandrolone Phenylpropionate); empty query
  shows a curated "Popular in comp prep" list + the user's saved compounds; no match
  shows "'[query]' not found". A **"Make your own"** option sits at the bottom of the
  list always → a form that saves a custom compound to **`localStorage` keyed per
  user** (`trackd.customCompounds.<uid>`), persisting on that device for that user.
  Custom compounds are **editable + deletable** (tap your compound → edit; delete is
  behind a confirm warning); **duplicate names are blocked** (vs catalogue + your
  own), name is capped at 80 chars, and a failed localStorage write surfaces a
  non-fatal notice. Form pickers are **on-brand dark "pill" selectors** (not native
  `<select>`, which can't be forced dark on mobile). The per-row "+" is visual for
  now (real "add to stack" needs the cycle feature).
- **Round-2 hardening of the Add-to-Stack sheet (2026-06-08, post-audit).** A
  6-dimension multi-agent audit (36 raw → 28 verified findings) drove: **8 distinct
  category dot hues** (`--cat-*` tokens in `globals.css`, documented in
  `ui-context.md`); **search icon = magnifier** (was a grid glyph); **generator now
  validates** category/unit/route/inventory and a **`prebuild` npm hook** regenerates
  `lib/compounds-catalogue.ts` on every build (CSV can't ship stale); `crypto.randomUUID`
  **fallback** (it throws over a plain-http LAN IP — i.e. on-phone QA — so "Make your
  own" would have broken); a **render guard** so a corrupt/unknown category can't crash
  the sheet; keyboard-hide now **gated on a focused editable element** (pinch-zoom can't
  hide the nav); **focus moves into the form** on open; bigger (~44px) drag target.
  `npm run build` + `npm run lint` clean; a dev-only **`/preview`** route (404s in prod)
  renders the nav + sheet without auth for review. **Not pushed/deployed.** NB: local
  run of the *real* signed-in app needs a `.env.local` (see below) — without it every
  Supabase-backed page 500s; `/preview` works without it.
- **Compounds catalogue bundled into the app (2026-06-08).** `lib/compounds-catalogue.ts`
  (generated, 149 compounds) is produced from `supabase/seed/compounds.csv` by
  `supabase/seed/build-compounds-data.mjs` — the CSV stays the single source of truth
  (same file that seeds the DB). Taxonomy/labels/option-lists live in the
  hand-authored `lib/compound-categories.ts`. The app reads this static module so the
  Add-to-Stack search works offline (PWA) with no auth/network dependency; swap to a
  live Supabase read later if the catalogue needs to update without a redeploy.
- Next.js 16 (App Router) + React 19 + Tailwind v4 starter scaffolded.
- Canonical schema authored: `supabase/trackd_schema_v0_4_2.sql` (16 tables,
  2 views) + `supabase/trackd_storage_policies.sql`.
- **Data model APPLIED + VERIFIED on the live project (2026-06-06).** Two tracked
  migrations via the Supabase MCP: `20260606042525_schema_v0_4_2` then
  `20260606042547_storage_policies_v0_4_2`. Post-apply verification passed:
  16 tables + 2 views (both `security_invoker=true`); RLS enabled on every table
  with policies present (profiles 3, rest `FOR ALL`); 16 enums; 7 functions;
  11 public triggers + the `on_auth_user_created` trigger on `auth.users`; the
  private `bloodwork` storage bucket (public=false, 10MB, PDF/image mimes) + its
  4 owner-scoped `storage.objects` policies. No errors.
- **Seed catalogues loaded + VERIFIED on the live project (2026-06-06).** Two
  tracked migrations via the MCP: `catalogue_enums_and_reference_ranges` then
  `seed_catalogues`. From Adrian's CSVs (now in `supabase/seed/`): **149 compounds,
  41 biomarkers, 4 IGF-1 reference ranges**. Adrian-approved schema deltas:
  `compound_category` extended with `sarm`/`thyroid`/`stimulant`, `dose_unit`
  extended with `g`, and a new **`reference_ranges`** table (age/sex-banded; NULL
  sex = any) for IGF-1's age-dependent ranges — stored only, not wired into
  interpretation. Biomarker unit mojibake (`Âµg/dL` → `µg/dL`, `10â¹/L` → `10⁹/L`,
  etc.) repaired on the way in. Seed is reproducible: edit the CSV → run
  `node supabase/seed/build-seed-sql.mjs` → idempotent `ON CONFLICT` inserts.
  Post-seed verification passed: counts exact, 0 rows with bad encoding, 0 null
  categories, all 4 ranges FK-linked to IGF-1, `reference_ranges` RLS on with a
  single read-only-to-authed policy. Live DB now **17 tables**.
- **Markers seed catalogue loaded + VERIFIED on the live project (2026-06-08).**
  Adrian's Markers CSV (`supabase/seed/markers.csv`, 36 markers) seeded the
  pre-existing `markers` table via a third tracked migration, `seed_markers` —
  built the same reproducible way as the other catalogues (CSV → extended
  `build-seed-sql.mjs` → idempotent `ON CONFLICT (name) DO UPDATE`; the generated
  `002_seed_catalogues.sql` now carries all three catalogues + ranges). **No
  schema change needed:** `marker_polarity` already = `{positive,negative,neutral}`,
  unlike compounds (which needed enum extensions). `tier_labels` are stored
  pipe-split into `text[]`. Post-seed verification passed: 36 rows
  (12 positive / 21 negative / 3 neutral; 14 default / 22 optional), 0 null/empty
  tier arrays, 0 empty names, 0 mojibake; RLS on with the **same single
  read-only-to-authed SELECT policy and no write policy** as `compounds` /
  `biomarkers` (confirmed by a side-by-side `pg_policies` check). Table count
  unchanged — `markers` was always one of the 18 tables; only its contents are new.
- **Legal documents stored in the DB (2026-06-06).** New `legal_documents` table
  (18th table) + `legal_doc_type` enum, added via two tracked migrations
  (`legal_documents_table`, `seed_legal_documents`; SQL in `supabase/legal/`).
  Holds the **Terms of Service (v0.2)**, **Privacy Policy (v0.1)**, and **Medical
  Disclaimer (v0.2)** text — stored verbatim, encoding mojibake repaired, Privacy
  Policy's inline "⚠ NOTE" drafting blocks retained (Adrian's instruction). All
  `is_beta = true`, `is_current = true`, `effective_date = NULL` ("set on launch").
  RLS on; **public read** (`anon` + `authenticated`, since signup shows them
  pre-auth), service-role-only writes. Verified: 3 rows, one current per type, no
  mojibake. **Store-only — NOT wired into signup.** Versioning/dating rule + the
  launch-day bump-to-1.0 procedure recorded in `architecture.md` → "Legal
  Documents"; launch checklist in `next-tasks.md`.
  **Reviewed + approved by both co-founders (2026-06-06)** — text signed off as-is;
  versions stay 0.2 / 0.1 / 0.2 (beta), with the bump to 1.0 + effective date still
  to happen at launch.
- **Supabase client layer wired (2026-06-06).** `@supabase/ssr` +
  `@supabase/supabase-js` installed; `lib/supabase/client.ts` (browser),
  `lib/supabase/server.ts` (server, async `cookies()` + try/catch write guard),
  `lib/supabase/middleware.ts` (`updateSession` — refresh-only, `getClaims()`),
  and root `proxy.ts` (Next 16's renamed-from-middleware hook) created.
  `.env.local` (git-ignored) holds the real URL + publishable key; `.env.example`
  committed. `npm run build` passes and shows `ƒ Proxy (Middleware)` with no
  deprecation warning. Pattern research-verified against installed versions +
  Supabase docs and adversarially checked for the auth-session footguns.
- **Deployed to Vercel + live on the custom domain (2026-06-06).** App imported to
  Vercel (project `trackd-co-app`), Production env vars set
  (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` + `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`,
  non-sensitive) and serving. Custom domain **https://trackdco.app** live and
  verified externally (DNS A `216.198.79.1`, HTTPS 200, valid SSL). First deploy
  500'd on missing build-time env vars — fixed by setting them and redeploying
  with build cache OFF (`NEXT_PUBLIC_` vars inline at build time).
- **Public landing shipped + live (2026-06-06).** App-style **First Run** onboarding
  merged `feat/landing` → `main` and verified live on https://trackdco.app (HTTP 200).
  Mobile-first swipeable carousel (hero → stack → site rotation → inventory) with
  product mini-mocks (placeholders for the real app UI), restrained gold accents, a
  2s auto-advance tour (snap-toggle for iOS), scroll-coupled parallax, and a
  "Continue with Google" CTA → `/login`. Desktop = "open on your phone" gate
  (mobile-only by intent). On-brand `/login` + `/terms` + `/privacy` placeholders.
  Built from a multi-lens design critique; CodeRabbit review applied (metadata/OG,
  a11y, no-404s). `app/layout.tsx` gained native wiring (`themeColor`, `colorScheme`
  dark, `viewport-fit: cover`); `updateSession` now **fails open** when Supabase env
  is unset (a missing/mis-scoped var can't 500 the whole site).
- **Brand icons wired into the app (2026-06-07).** Adrian's logo (1563×1563 PNG,
  master at `app/logo-source.png`) set as the site's icons via Next.js 16's `app/`
  file conventions: **`favicon.ico`** (48×48, replaces the old default Next.js favicon
  — browser tab), **`icon.png`** (512×512 — modern favicon + Android/PWA),
  **`apple-icon.png`** (180×180 — the iOS home-screen Apple Touch icon). All resized
  from the source with macOS `sips` (no ImageMagick/Pillow on the machine;
  `sips -s format ico` makes a valid single-size `.ico`). Verification each time: local
  dev server shows the rendered `<head>` carrying all three tags (`rel="icon"` ×2 +
  `rel="apple-touch-icon"`) with correct `sizes`/`type`, each icon URL returns HTTP
  200, and the served `apple-icon.png` is a byte-for-byte (SHA-256) match to disk.
  **Logo revised same day:** v1 was the "TrackdCo" wordmark (committed, pushed, and
  confirmed live on trackdco.app — prod URLs 200 + SHA-match); Adrian then swapped in
  the shorter **"Trackd"** wordmark (gold "d"), icons regenerated from the new master
  and re-verified locally. The "Trackd" mark fills the frame more, so it reads better
  at 16px tab size than the wordmark did. Pushing `main` is what deploys icons to
  trackdco.app; favicons cache hard, so seeing a change needs a private window (tab)
  or delete-and-re-add to Home Screen (Apple Touch icon).
- **Auth + app shell built — code complete, locally verified (2026-06-08).**
  Method = Google OAuth (`@supabase/ssr`, PKCE — verified against current Supabase
  docs). Shipped: `components/auth/google-sign-in-button.tsx` (`signInWithOAuth`),
  `app/auth/callback/route.ts` (`exchangeCodeForSession` + open-redirect guard on
  `next`), a real `/login` screen (replaced the placeholder), the one-time
  **18+/ToS gate** at `/welcome` (`gate-form.tsx` + `actions.ts` — server-side age
  validation ≥18, single acceptance covering all three docs, writes
  `date_of_birth`/`is_18_plus`/`tos_accepted_at`/`tos_version` to the user's own
  profile, ToS version read live from `legal_documents`), the guarded `(app)`
  route group (`layout.tsx` runs `getUser()` + the gate check) with an empty
  `/dashboard` and sign-out, the root redirect for logged-in users, and a PWA
  install prompt (`components/pwa/install-prompt.tsx`) + web manifest
  (`app/manifest.ts`) + Apple web-app meta. `lib/auth.ts` (`getSessionContext`) is
  the single source of truth for "passed the gate". The landing CTA now triggers
  real sign-in. Verified: `npm run build` + `npm run lint` clean; `/dashboard` and
  `/welcome` 307 → `/login` with no session; the three legal pages render verbatim
  from the DB. Live OAuth + RLS test still pending Google provider config (see In
  Progress).
- **Legal docs wired into signup + rendered from the DB (2026-06-08).** `/terms`,
  `/privacy`, `/medical-disclaimer` now render the current version verbatim from
  `legal_documents` via one shared `components/legal/legal-document.tsx`
  (replacing the "coming soon" placeholders); the gate links + records acceptance
  of all three. Reverses the prior "stored only — not wired into signup" note in
  `architecture.md` (updated).
- **API role grants applied — Data API now works (2026-06-08).** Discovered during
  verification that **no** `public` table was reachable by the API roles: `anon`
  and `authenticated` held only `REFERENCES/TRIGGER/TRUNCATE` (no SELECT/INSERT/
  UPDATE/DELETE), so every Data API call returned `42501 permission denied` —
  including the gate's `profiles` UPDATE and the legal-doc reads. Root cause: the
  schema/seed/legal migrations enabled RLS + policies but never granted table
  privileges to the PostgREST roles, and this project's Supabase defaults don't
  auto-grant. Fixed with the tracked `api_role_grants` migration (SQL in
  `supabase/grants/001_api_role_grants.sql`): `legal_documents` SELECT → anon +
  authenticated; catalogues SELECT → authenticated; user tables full DML →
  authenticated; `profiles` SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE; views SELECT → authenticated.
  RLS is unchanged and still the only row-level gate. Verified post-apply: anon
  reads `legal_documents` (200), anon is correctly denied the authed-only
  catalogues (42501), pages render.
- Context system written: `project-overview.md`, `architecture.md`,
  `code-standards.md`, `ai-workflow-rules.md`, `ui-context.md`.
- `ui-context.md` signed off by Adrian (co-founder) (2026-06-05): theme, colour tokens,
  typography, radius, layout, component library, and icons all locked.
- Design-system foundation wired (`npm run build` passes): all colour tokens in
  `app/globals.css` (`:root` + `@theme inline`); Geist + Geist Mono + Playfair
  Display (serif) via `next/font` in `app/layout.tsx`; shadcn/ui installed
  (`components.json`, `lib/utils.ts`, first `button` component) with its semantic
  tokens mapped onto the Trackd palette; Lucide installed. Deps added:
  class-variance-authority, clsx, tailwind-merge, lucide-react, tw-animate-css,
  radix-ui.
- **Supabase project provisioned** (project ref `boqqracwdpuisgvwbqlc`).
- **Supabase MCP connected + authenticated** (2026-06-06): `.mcp.json` points at
  the hosted Supabase MCP (database + docs features); OAuth completed; the
  database/docs tools are live. Confirmed working against the live project
  (`list_tables` → empty public schema, as expected before the schema is applied).
- **Supabase agent skills installed + committed** (commit `47bb76b`, 2026-06-06):
  `supabase` and `supabase-postgres-best-practices` installed via skills.sh into
  `.agents/skills/`, symlinked into `.claude/skills/` for Claude Code discovery,
  and pinned in `skills-lock.json`.

- **Auth — deployed + verified; Week-1 checkpoint essentially met (2026-06-08).**
  Built, Google OAuth set up, merged to `main`, live on trackdco.app, and
  **sign-in confirmed on both founders' phones** (Angus `admin@trackdco.app`,
  Adrian `adrianschimizzi1@gmail.com`). **RLS isolation VERIFIED with the two real
  accounts** (success criterion #3): simulating each user's `authenticated` JWT
  context, each saw only their own `profiles` + `cycles` row and never the other's;
  cross-user INSERT was blocked by the `WITH CHECK` policy (`42501`); all test data
  rolled back (0 rows persisted). Both ownership patterns proven (`id = auth.uid()`
  and `user_id = auth.uid()`); the two views are `security_invoker` so they inherit
  the same filtering (storage-bucket isolation to be checked once bloodwork uploads
  exist, wk3). Recorded in Completed.

## In Progress

- **App UI — two parallel lanes (PR-based, CodeRabbit-reviewed).** Adrian → the
  **core loop** (cycles → compounds → inventory → dose logging) on `feat/app-ui`.
  Angus + Claude → **Profile & Settings** (`/settings`) on `feat/settings` — v1
  built (read-only account block + editable sex/height/goal/units, server-validated
  + RLS-scoped to the user's own row), **PR #2 open — CodeRabbit review came back
  clean (no actionable comments); ready to merge** (build + lint + guard verified).
  NB the nav link to `/settings` is a deferred shared-layout (`app/(app)/layout.tsx`)
  change to coordinate with Adrian.
- **Auth — effectively done; one tester-gating task left:** **publish the Google
  OAuth app** (Audience → Publish App) before any non-Test-user can sign in. Sign-in,
  the 18+/ToS gate, RLS isolation, and the branded PWA launch splash are all live +
  verified on both founders' phones.

## Tooling

- **Vercel plugin for coding agents installed (2026-06-06).** `vercel-plugin@vercel`
  v0.43.0 installed at **user scope** via `npx plugins add vercel/vercel-plugin
  --target claude-code` (Bun installed to `~/.bun` as its prerequisite — global
  `npm i -g` was blocked by `/usr/local` perms, so used the official `bun.sh`
  installer). Provides 26 Vercel skills, 3 specialist agents (`deployment-expert`,
  `performance-optimizer`, `ai-architect`), `/vercel-plugin:*` slash commands, an
  MCP server, and session-start hooks. Registered in `~/.claude/plugins/`. Loads
  on the next Claude Code session restart; the bundled MCP/CLI needs Vercel auth
  on first use of the deploy commands. NB: the no-`plugins`-tool conclusion from
  an earlier check was wrong — this is an official June-2026 Vercel release
  (docs: vercel.com/docs/agent-resources/vercel-plugin).

### Feature Specs

- **`Context/Feature Specs/01-design-system.md` — ✅ Complete (verified
  2026-06-06).** Implementation audited against the spec and `ui-context.md`:
  tokens in `app/globals.css` (`:root` + `@theme inline`) match `ui-context.md`
  exactly; fonts wired in `app/layout.tsx`; `components.json` config +
  `lib/utils.ts` `cn()` correct; shadcn semantic token map present and on-theme;
  deps and Lucide installed; `button` is the only primitive (further added
  incrementally per spec). All "Check When Done" items pass — no hardcoded hex
  outside `globals.css`, and `npm run build` passes.

## Open Questions

- DB-enforced cycle limits: left as an app-layer decision; tester behaviour
  decides post-beta. (Single-active-cycle index stays commented in the schema.)
- **Legal copy — parked edits inside the Privacy Policy (stored verbatim, not yet
  actioned per "store only").** Three items Adrian flagged in the source need a
  decision before launch: (1) §7 Data retention — Adrian asked Claude to state, in
  the section body, the two confirmed facts (deletion is requested via an in-app
  button; deletion completes within 30 days); the **backup retention window is
  still unconfirmed** and must be nailed down. (2) §9 Your rights — Adrian wants a
  clause that we comply with whatever data-protection law applies in the user's
  region (needs legal sign-off that this is sound). (3) §5/§10 — Supabase + Vercel
  **regions** must be named to complete the storage + international-transfers
  sections. These are intentionally untouched until Adrian directs the edits.

## Architecture Decisions

- **Vercel functions pinned to Sydney `syd1` (2026-06-09).** Root `vercel.json`
  `{"regions":["syd1"]}` sets the default function region; they were defaulting to
  `iad1` (US East) while Supabase + users are AU, so every SSR page paid a US
  round-trip plus US↔Sydney hops per auth/data call. Single region = Hobby-OK.
  Note: `preferredRegion` in code is NOT the lever (it only applies with
  `runtime='edge'`; the app is Node for `@supabase/ssr`). Revisit multi-region on Pro.
- **iOS PWA install is manual-only — no shortcut exists (2026-06-09).** Settled by
  two adversarially-verified research workflows: iOS has no programmatic
  Add-to-Home-Screen, `navigator.share()`'s sheet doesn't contain the action,
  `app.link`/Branch is native-app deep-linking (irrelevant to a PWA, and NOT a push
  provider), and `.mobileconfig` web-clip profiles are more friction + trust-toxic.
  So the install prompt's job is completion/clarity, never automation. **Push
  notifications (when built) = standard Web Push** (VAPID + service worker via
  `web-push`, or OneSignal/FCM); **iOS push needs the PWA installed to the home screen
  first**. Full reference in memory `pwa-install-and-push-reality`.
- **PostgREST role grants are explicit, RLS stays the only row gate (2026-06-08).**
  The Data API needs a table-level `GRANT` to `anon`/`authenticated` before RLS
  even runs; this project's Supabase defaults don't auto-grant, so grants are
  declared in `supabase/grants/001_api_role_grants.sql` (migration
  `api_role_grants`). Grants follow the documented access model (public-read legal
  docs, authed-read catalogues, authed full DML on user tables, no profile
  self-delete, view reads). They open the table; RLS still gates the rows.
  Consequence: **every new `public` table must ship its own grants** (or we set
  `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`), else it 42501s on the API.
- **18+/ToS gate accepts all three legal docs in one consent (2026-06-08).**
  Angus's call: the single acceptance at `/welcome` covers Terms + Privacy +
  Medical Disclaimer (each linked), recorded as `tos_accepted_at` + `tos_version`
  (the ToS version, read live from `legal_documents`). Strongest coverage for a
  peptide/AAS tracker — the medical disclaimer is acknowledged up front. The gate
  is the authoritative app entry: `(app)` layout redirects to `/welcome` until
  `is_18_plus AND tos_accepted_at`.
- **`legal_documents` is a new (18th) table for versioned legal text (2026-06-06).**
  ToS / Privacy / Medical Disclaimer text now lives in the DB, one row per
  `(doc_type, version)` with `is_current` (partial unique index = one current per
  type). Same service-role-write model as the seed catalogues, but **read is public
  (`anon` + `authenticated`)** — a deliberate deviation from the authed-only
  catalogues, because signup must show the documents before an account exists
  (Adrian-approved). Stored only; not wired into signup. Versioning rule (whole
  numbers; bump all to 1.0 + freeze the date at launch; bump+re-date per change)
  lives in `architecture.md` → "Legal Documents".
- **Catalogue taxonomy extended to fit the seed, not the reverse (2026-06-06).**
  Adrian's compounds seed used 3 categories (`sarm`, `thyroid`, `stimulant`) and a
  unit (`g`) beyond the original v0.4.2 enums. Decision (Adrian): extend the enums
  via `ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE` rather than remap the data, preserving the seed's
  intended granularity. `g` is a catalogue *default_unit* pre-fill only and does
  not affect the inventory unit-family trigger (which still governs mg↔mcg vs iu on
  real inventory items; `v_inventory_math` does not convert grams).
- **`reference_ranges` is a new (17th) table for age-banded ranges (2026-06-06).**
  IGF-1 falls with age, which the flat male/female columns on `biomarkers` can't
  express. New service-role-write-only catalogue, same RLS as `biomarkers`. `sex`
  is nullable (NULL = any) rather than extending `sex_type`. Unique constraint uses
  `NULLS NOT DISTINCT` (PG15+) so NULL-sex rows still de-dupe on re-seed. Stored for
  reference only — **not** wired into interpretation (invariants 3 & 4); the IGF-1
  source data is explicitly flagged indicative/assay-dependent.
- **App is served at the root `trackdco.app`, not a subdomain (2026-06-06).**
  Angus's call — the app *is* the domain for now (no separate marketing site at
  the root). Reverses the earlier `app.trackdco.app` assumption. Apex domains
  can't use a CNAME, so DNS at Porkbun uses an A record (Vercel's IP) or an ALIAS
  → `cname.vercel-dns.com`; the Vercel "redirect apex to www" option is left OFF
  so the bare root serves the app directly.
- **Landing is a mobile-only, app-style onboarding (2026-06-06).** The public entry
  at trackdco.app is a swipeable "First Run" carousel built to feel like a native
  app, not a marketing page (founder direction). Desktop gets an "open on your
  phone" gate. Two `ui-context` nuances were relaxed *for the onboarding surface
  only*: (a) amber is used as a restrained recurring accent (progress fill,
  eyebrows, the "due" elements) rather than strictly once-per-screen — the in-app
  **health-data categorical / never-evaluative** invariant is untouched; (b) the
  feature cards are honest **placeholder mocks**, to be swapped for the real app
  screens once built. Also: `updateSession` now **fails open** when the Supabase
  env is unset, so a missing/mis-scoped var can't 500 the whole site (the real auth
  gate is `getUser()` in protected pages, so this is safe).
- **Stack is Next.js 16, not 14** — repo has `next@16.2.7`. APIs differ from
  older training data; read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before using a Next
  API you're unsure about (per `AGENTS.md`).
- **Next 16 renamed `middleware` → `proxy` (2026-06-06).** The root request hook
  is `proxy.ts` exporting `export async function proxy(request)`; a legacy
  `middleware.ts` still works but emits a build deprecation warning. The
  `runtime` option is not allowed in proxy files (proxy defaults to Node, fine
  for `@supabase/ssr`). Verified in the installed Next docs + build output.
- **Publishable key is the client key (2026-06-06).** App uses the new
  `sb_publishable_…` key via `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, not the
  legacy `anon` JWT / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (deprecates end-2026). The
  server secret key (successor to `service_role`) will be `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`
  (server-only, no `NEXT_PUBLIC_`) — not yet provisioned. RLS gates all access,
  so the publishable key is browser-safe.
- **Auth-session refresh uses `getClaims()`, refresh-only for now.** `proxy.ts`
  delegates to `updateSession()`; no redirect guard until auth screens exist.
  Open item: confirm the project uses asymmetric JWT signing keys so
  `getClaims()` can verify locally — else fall back to `getUser()`.
- **Cycles are archived, never hard-deleted.** Confirmed 2026-06-05. The
  delete cascade (cycle → protocol compounds → inventory → dose logs) is kept
  for account deletion only; the app must archive via `is_active = false` and
  never expose a hard "Delete cycle". Now an invariant in `architecture.md`.
- **Schema reviewed before deploy (2026-06-05).** `trackd_schema_v0_4_2.sql`
  given a full read-through; verdict = sound. Pre-deploy refinements bumped it
  v0.4.1 → v0.4.2 (never deployed, so amended in place): UNIQUE on seed-catalogue
  names (compounds/biomarkers/markers); `handle_new_user()` profile insert made
  idempotent with `ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING` so a trigger hiccup can't break
  signup; cycle archive-not-delete documented in-schema. Injection-site rotation
  confirmed fully covered by `injection_site` + `dose_logs` (visual is derived,
  nothing to store).
- Locked decisions and invariants live in `architecture.md` and
  `project-overview.md` (never store derived values; RLS on every table with
  `(SELECT auth.uid())`; categorical-not-evaluative health data; entitlement
  gates read `profiles.tier` only). Not repeated here — see those files.

## Session Notes

- 2026-06-09: **Plus-button Shortcuts menu built + iterated with Adrian** (spec
  `Context/Feature Specs/03-shortcuts-control-creation.md`, followed step-by-step, then
  refined live on `/preview`). A prior session had done Step 1 (`shortcutItems.ts`) +
  Step 2 (`ShortcutItem.tsx`) before crashing; resumed and built the rest
  (`PlaceholderActionSheet`, `ShortcutsMenu`, plus-button wiring, the reorder addition +
  `lib/shortcutOrder.ts`). Then iterated with Adrian over several rounds: **two-tier
  layout** (top circle quick-actions + bottom reorderable cards) from a MacroFactor
  reference; renamed items (Today's dose → "Log", Weight, Blood work) and re-iconed
  (`ListChecks`, `Scale`); sans (not serif) centred title; restrained **amber** accents;
  reorder trigger changed **long-press → a grey pencil "Edit" button** (more discoverable)
  with **tap-any-shortcut-to-finish**; Add-a-compound made reorderable (defaults bottom);
  and a full **motion pass** (staggered entrance, tap light-up ripple, eased edit-mode
  height/fade, Edit⇄Done cross-fade). Two deliberate judgement calls held throughout:
  (a) reach the **unchanged** Add-to-Stack flow by navigation, never refactoring it
  (protected); (b) **no new animation/drag dependency** — pointer drag + plain-CSS
  keyframes, given the touch-PWA + flaky-npm. Verified the Add-to-Stack **category dots
  are intact** (Adrian flagged them as possibly removed — they were never touched).
  `tsc` + `lint` clean throughout; **NB: don't run `npm run build` while `next dev` is up
  — they share `.next` and a concurrent build 500s with "Cannot find module page.js"**
  (the dev server stays healthy; just build with dev stopped). Landed via PR
  `feat/shortcuts-menu` for CodeRabbit review.
- 2026-06-09: **Perf (Sydney region), branding, toolchain, PWA-install honesty.**
  (1) **Amber wordmark** — "co" recoloured from muted grey to `--accent-amber` across
  all 7 wordmark spots (app shell, login, welcome, first-run, preview, legal, landing).
  (2) **Big perf win — Vercel functions moved `iad1`→`syd1`** via root `vercel.json`.
  Angus reported the app felt slow (sign-out, reload); measured it: warm app TTFB was a
  steady ~330–480ms from AU, but Supabase was ~40ms (already Sydney) — so the lag was
  Vercel running in US East. Pinned `syd1`; re-measured ~210ms warm + confirmed
  `x-vercel-id: sin1::syd1`. (3) **Toolchain** — installed `gh` 2.93 + Vercel CLI 54.10
  user-level (no Homebrew/sudo: npm global prefix → `~/.local`, PATH in `~/.zshrc`);
  **`~/dev/trackd-co-app` confirmed as the healthy canonical repo** (all pushes ran from
  it, no mmap errors). CLI auth still pending (Angus: `gh auth login` / `vercel login`).
  (4) **PWA install — researched then made honest.** Angus wanted a one-tap "Add to Home
  Screen" / asked about `app.link` (from a video). Two multi-agent research workflows
  (~60 sources, 3 fact-checkers each) confirmed: iOS gives a website **no** way to
  trigger/shortcut Add-to-Home-Screen; `navigator.share()` opens a sheet that lacks the
  action (verified on his phone — actions were Copy/Reading List/Amazon…);
  **`app.link` = Branch deep-linking for NATIVE apps**, not PWAs, and **not** a push
  provider; `.mobileconfig` profiles are worse + trust-toxic. Rebuilt the card to
  maximise completion: dropped the misleading share button; **detect in-app webviews
  (Instagram/TikTok/Facebook) + non-Safari iOS browsers → "Open in Safari"**; iOS-26
  "•••"-menu wording; added the "View More" step (per his screenshots). Android keeps
  real one-tap. All shipped + live. (5) **Push path banked** for later (memory
  `pwa-install-and-push-reality`): Web Push (VAPID + SW via `web-push`, or OneSignal);
  iOS push requires home-screen install first. Everything pushed direct to `main` (gh
  not yet authed for the PR flow); region/install changes are low-risk + user-requested.
- 2026-06-08 (cont.): **RLS verified, PWA splash, repo move, PR flow, parallel
  lanes started.** Sign-in confirmed on both founders' phones; **two-account RLS
  isolation VERIFIED** (each user sees only their own profiles/cycles rows;
  cross-user INSERT blocked by `WITH CHECK`; all test data rolled back) — success
  criterion #3 met. Shipped a branded **PWA launch splash**: 8 iOS
  apple-touch-startup-image PNGs (Trackd mark on #111110) + the legacy
  `apple-mobile-web-app-capable` meta Next 16 omits (the actual fix — iOS was
  ignoring the launch images without it), `start_url=/dashboard`, and an Android
  maskable icon — confirmed working on iOS. **Moved the repo out of iCloud** to
  `~/dev/trackd-co-app` (the `mmap`/stale-NFS git errors are gone; old `~/Documents`
  copy to be deleted). **Adopted a PR-based flow** so CodeRabbit reviews code before
  `main` (it only reviews PRs; the auth+splash work had bypassed it — PR #1's old
  findings were already addressed). Started the **parallel app-UI lanes**: Adrian on
  the core loop (`feat/app-ui`), Angus + Claude on **Profile & Settings**
  (`feat/settings`, **PR #2** — first PR in the new flow, in CodeRabbit review).
- 2026-06-08: **Auth deployed live + DOB picker improved.** Angus completed the
  Google OAuth dashboard setup; tested the full flow locally with a real account
  and it worked end-to-end (sign-in → `handle_new_user` trigger → gate → dashboard,
  all values written). Reworked the gate's date-of-birth field from a native
  calendar (paged month-by-month — brutal for a birthday) to Day/Month/Year
  dropdowns + hardened server date validation. Merged `feat/auth` → `main` and
  deployed to trackdco.app; verified in prod (manifest 200, route guards redirect,
  legal docs render from the DB, login button present). **The merge had to be run
  in a `/tmp` clone** — the local repo's git kept failing with `mmap`/stale-NFS
  errors (iCloud-synced `~/Documents`; permanent fix is to move the repo out of
  `~/Documents`). Remaining for the checkpoint: on-phone test, two-account RLS
  isolation, publish the Google app.
- 2026-06-08: **Markers catalogue seeded.** Adrian supplied the Markers CSV (36
  subjective-tracking markers — energy/libido/sleep/pumps… plus side-effects as
  negative-polarity markers). Added it as `supabase/seed/markers.csv`, extended
  `build-seed-sql.mjs` to emit a markers `INSERT` (pipe-split `tier_labels` →
  `text[]`, `TRUE`/`FALSE` → boolean), regenerated `002_seed_catalogues.sql`, and
  applied it to the live DB as the `seed_markers` tracked migration. No schema/enum
  change required (the `marker_polarity` enum already covered all values). Verified
  it's accessible exactly like the compounds + biomarkers catalogues: 36 rows, RLS
  on, single read-only-to-authed SELECT policy, no write policy (service-role-only).
  This closes the last open seed-catalogue item.
- 2026-06-08: **Auth + app shell built.** Verified the `@supabase/ssr` PKCE
  patterns against current Supabase docs (skill-driven), then built the whole
  flow: Google sign-in, `/auth/callback` exchange, the `/welcome` 18+/ToS gate
  (server-side age check; all-three-docs consent per Angus), the guarded `(app)`
  shell + empty `/dashboard` + sign-out, the root redirect, a PWA install prompt +
  manifest, and real legal-doc pages rendered from the DB. **Caught a live
  blocker during verification:** the Data API returned 42501 on every table — the
  API roles had no SELECT/DML grants (RLS + policies existed but the migrations
  never granted table privileges, and this project doesn't auto-grant). Applied
  the `api_role_grants` migration to fix it (RLS unchanged). `npm run build` +
  `lint` clean; guards + legal rendering verified. Remaining before the 11 Jun
  checkpoint: Angus's one-time Google OAuth dashboard setup, then the hard
  fresh-account test + two-account RLS isolation check.
- 2026-06-07: **Brand icons set, then logo swapped.** Adrian first supplied the
  "TrackdCo" logo; saved it as `app/logo-source.png` (master) and generated the three
  Next.js `app/` icons with `sips` (`favicon.ico` 48×48, `icon.png` 512×512,
  `apple-icon.png` 180×180). Committed → Adrian pushed → verified **live on
  trackdco.app** (prod head tags present, all icon URLs 200, served `apple-icon.png`
  SHA-256-matches disk). The "not showing" question afterward was just favicon caching,
  not a deploy fault. Adrian then **replaced the logo with the shorter "Trackd"
  wordmark (gold "d")**, overwriting `logo-source.png`; regenerated all three icons and
  re-verified locally the same way (new asset hashes, URLs 200, SHA-match). Committed to
  `main`; left unpushed pending Adrian's go-ahead (push = Vercel prod deploy).
- 2026-06-06: **Legal documents stored.** Adrian supplied the Terms of Service
  (v0.2), Privacy Policy (v0.1), and Medical Disclaimer (v0.2). Confirmed the
  approach with him first (public read; create + apply now), then added the
  `legal_documents` table + enum and seeded the three docs as two tracked
  migrations (SQL in `supabase/legal/`). Text stored verbatim with encoding
  mojibake repaired; Privacy Policy's inline "⚠ NOTE" blocks kept per his
  instruction. Store-only — not wired into signup. Recorded the versioning/dating
  rule (bump all to 1.0 + freeze date at launch; whole-number bumps + re-date per
  change; drop "beta" from filenames at release) in `architecture.md` and the
  launch checklist in `next-tasks.md`. Three Privacy-Policy edits Adrian flagged in
  the copy are parked as open questions until he directs them.
  Later same day: both co-founders reviewed the full text and **approved it as-is**
  — signed off at v0.2 / v0.1 / v0.2 (beta), pending the launch-day bump to 1.0.
- 2026-06-06: **Seed catalogues loaded.** Adrian supplied the Compounds,
  Biomarkers, and IGF-1 reference-range CSVs. Committed them (corrected) under
  `supabase/seed/` with a CSV→SQL generator, then applied two tracked migrations:
  enum extensions + the new `reference_ranges` table, then the seed data (149
  compounds / 41 biomarkers / 4 ranges). Confirmed before acting with Adrian and
  got explicit sign-off on the two schema deltas (extend enums; create
  `reference_ranges`). Fixed biomarker-unit mojibake in flight. Verified counts,
  encoding, RLS, and FK links. `markers` catalogue still to be built — spec handed
  to Adrian and parked in `next-tasks.md`.
- 2026-06-06: **App live on the custom domain.** Pointed `trackdco.app` (root) at
  the Vercel deploy — added an A record at Porkbun (host blank → `216.198.79.1`),
  deleted Porkbun's two parking records, left the Google Workspace MX + TXT
  intact. Verified externally: DNS resolves, HTTPS 200, valid SSL, page renders.
  Decision locked: app served on the bare root (not a subdomain). 7 Jun checkpoint
  hit a day early — Supabase live, schema applied, deploy proven, domain live.
- 2026-06-06: **Deployed to Vercel + installed the Vercel plugin.** Angus created
  the Vercel account (GitHub signup; both founders are abroad on travel data
  eSIMs, so SMS phone verification needed a workaround) and deployed — app is live
  on `*.vercel.app`. Then installed the official Vercel coding-agents plugin
  (`vercel-plugin@vercel` v0.43.0, user scope) after verifying `npx plugins add
  vercel/vercel-plugin` against Vercel's own docs — it's a real June-2026 release;
  an earlier in-session check had wrongly called the command fake. Bun installed
  as a prerequisite. Plugin loads on the next session restart. Next: confirm the
  deploy renders + point `app.trackdco.app`.
- 2026-06-06: **Supabase client layer wired.** Installed `@supabase/ssr` +
  `@supabase/supabase-js`; created browser/server/proxy clients + `updateSession`
  helper, `.env.local` (publishable key) + committed `.env.example`. Used a
  research → synthesise → adversarial-verify workflow because Next 16 broke the
  middleware API — it caught the `middleware` → `proxy` rename and confirmed the
  `getClaims()`/response-object pattern against installed types. `npm run build`
  passes (`ƒ Proxy (Middleware)`, no deprecation warning). Next: Vercel deploy.
- 2026-06-06: **Data model built.** Applied `trackd_schema_v0_4_2.sql` then
  `trackd_storage_policies.sql` to the live project as two tracked migrations via
  the MCP (`apply_migration`); full verification checklist passed (16 tables, 2
  views, RLS everywhere, private `bloodwork` bucket + 4 policies). The back end is
  now standing — next is wiring the app (clients + env + Vercel deploy).
- 2026-06-06: Supabase MCP wired up and authenticated; Supabase agent skills
  installed and pushed (commit `47bb76b`). Confirmed the live DB is still empty —
  the data model has not been applied yet. Split the tracking system: this file
  now records **state only**; all forward-looking steps moved to the new
  `Context/next-tasks.md`.
- 2026-06-05: `ui-context.md` completed and signed off — theme, tokens,
  typography, layout, shadcn/ui + Lucide locked and wired. Design system ready
  for the Week 1 auth screens.
- Timeline: Week 1 exit target 11 Jun; beta to 10–15 testers by 28 Jun.
