# Progress Tracker

Records the **state** of the build: what's done + the decisions behind it — the
rear-view mirror. Forward steps live in `Context/next-tasks.md`. The full
blow-by-blow history of every spec is in git; this file keeps only what a future
session needs at hand.

Last updated: 2026-07-20

## Current state (2026-07-20)

The app is **fully built and live on prod** (`trackdco.app`), in beta. Stack:
Next.js 16 + Supabase (Postgres / RLS / Auth / Storage) on Vercel (`syd1`). Live:
the data model, auth (Google + email/password), the core dose-logging loop,
Protocol (Plan + Stock), Progress (weight / bloodwork / journal / consistency /
photos), Calendar, Weight, injection-site maps, the reconstitution calculator,
push notifications, a billing scaffold, legal/consent, and the PWA install flow.

**Premium-minimal UI restyle — SHIPPED** (PR #59 squash `d501fff`; polish PR #60
`9a8c7aa`). Every in-app screen + sheet and every external surface moved to the
revised `ui-context.md`: borderless cards, small tracked-uppercase eyebrow titles,
light mono metric values, hairline dividers, compound type-icons (`<CategoryIcon>`),
disciplined amber (due/live beats only), and the retired display serif (Playfair +
`--font-display` gone repo-wide; `lucide-react` dropped). Palette unchanged (warm
near-black + gold amber — a cooler sample was trialled and rejected). Non-urgent
follow-ups (amber judgment calls, etc.) are in `next-tasks.md`.

## Shipped feature ledger

One line each; full detail in git + `Context/Feature Specs/`.

- **Foundation** — schema v0.4.2 (16 tables / 2 views, RLS everywhere), seed
  catalogues (compounds / biomarkers / markers / ranges), 18+/ToS gate, PWA shell +
  splash, legal docs in-DB, custom domain, Vercel `syd1`.
- **Auth** — Google OAuth + email/password + password reset; Resend custom SMTP.
- **Core loop** — home dashboard, add-to-stack, dose logging, per-compound
  injection-site rotation, back-dating (log/start on a past day).
- **Protocol** — `cycles → protocol_compounds → dose_logs` (Postgres canonical),
  Plan + Stock views, inventory maths from `v_inventory_math`, part-used vials,
  custom "make your own" compounds with vials.
- **Progress** — weight (hero + `/weight`), bloodwork photo store, journal + custom
  markers/scales, consistency graph, progress photos.
- **Spec 19** — injection-site rework: anatomical IM + Sub-Q region maps,
  mirror-front convention, sex-aware bodies (male + female), amber recency ramp.
- **Spec 20** — quick-actions FAB + Calculator nav slot.
- **Spec 21** — per-dose draw on the today's-log row (`50u (0.5 mL)`).
- **Spec 22** — per-dose hint, custom markers, compound soft-delete, journal photo
  attachments (migrations applied by hand + verified live on prod).
- **Specs 15 / 16 / 17** — cycle-id stamping (the moat), `profiles.tier` lock,
  Supabase advisor hardening.
- **Spec 14** — push notifications (transport + reminder scheduler, opened beyond
  founders; per-user timezone; `reminder-runner` cron `*/15`).
- **Spec 13** — perf + security hardening pass.
- **Other** — waitlist + founder dashboard, desktop interstitial (phone-only gate),
  beta feedback, archive/reactivation, splash animation, install prompts.

## Open Questions

- **Legal copy — parked Privacy Policy edits (stored verbatim, awaiting Adrian).**
  (1) §7 data retention — the backup-retention window is still unconfirmed;
  (2) §9 your rights — a "comply with the user's regional data-protection law"
  clause needs legal sign-off; (3) §5/§10 — Supabase + Vercel regions must be named.
  Untouched until Adrian directs the edits.
- DB-enforced cycle limits — left as an app-layer decision (the single-active-cycle
  index stays commented in the schema); tester behaviour decides post-beta.

## Architecture Decisions (durable — the ones a future session needs)

- **Vercel functions pinned to Sydney `syd1`** (`vercel.json`) — Supabase + users
  are AU; the US-East default added round-trips. `preferredRegion` is NOT the lever
  (edge-only; the app is Node for `@supabase/ssr`).
- **Every new `public` table must ship its own grants** — the Data API needs a
  table-level GRANT to `anon`/`authenticated` before RLS runs; this project doesn't
  auto-grant. Grants live in `supabase/grants/`; RLS still gates the rows.
- **`profiles.tier` is webhook-only** (column-level privilege, Spec 16) — any new
  `profiles` column must be added to the UPDATE **and** INSERT grant lists in a new
  `supabase/grants/00N_*` migration; new service-only columns stay out.
- **iOS PWA install is manual-only** — no programmatic Add-to-Home-Screen exists;
  the prompt's job is clarity, not automation. iOS push needs the PWA installed
  first. Web Push = VAPID + service worker (`web-push`). Memory:
  `pwa-install-and-push-reality`.
- **Next.js 16, not 14** — `middleware` → `proxy` (`proxy.ts`, Node runtime); read
  `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before using an unfamiliar Next API. Client key is
  the `sb_publishable_…` key; server secret is `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` (no `NEXT_PUBLIC_`).
- **Cycles are archived, never hard-deleted** (`is_active=false`); the delete cascade
  is for account deletion only. Compound "Delete" is also soft (Spec 22).
- **Migrations applied by hand (SQL Editor) don't appear in `list_migrations`** —
  verify schema state by querying `information_schema` / the schema directly, not the
  tracked-migrations list (e.g. Spec 22 is live but unlisted).
- **Don't run `npm run build` while `next dev` is up** — they share `.next`; a
  concurrent build 500s the dev server. Build with dev stopped.
- **Health data is categorical, never evaluative**; state colours (red/green/amber)
  are UI feedback only. Locked invariants live in `architecture.md` +
  `project-overview.md` (never store derived values; RLS `(SELECT auth.uid())` on
  every table; entitlement gates read `profiles.tier` only).

## Environment

- Supabase project ref `boqqracwdpuisgvwbqlc`; hosted MCP in `.mcp.json` (OAuth
  browser login can't run in the VS Code extension — hand-apply DDL via the SQL
  Editor when the MCP won't authenticate).
- Founder accounts: Angus `admin@trackdco.app`, Adrian `adrianschimizzi1@gmail.com`.
- `main` deploys straight to Vercel prod. UI/docs changes only need `next build` +
  `tsc` + `lint`; schema changes go through `supabase/` migrations or the SQL Editor.
