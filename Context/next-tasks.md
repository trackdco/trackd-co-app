## 🎯 Where we are

**`stack-dating` (off `main`) — merged to `main` 2026-08-01.** Adrian reported a
stack he had just made ("Vitamins": creatine + D3 + vitamin C) showing on days
before it existed. Root cause: a stack carried no date at all, so the dashboard
drew today's grouping over every day in history. Fixed by dating the stack and
each membership — Spec 01's forward-only rule applied to the one part of the
protocol that was missing it. See `architecture.md` → Stacks.

**⚠️ NEEDS ADRIAN, AT RELEASE: `supabase/protocol/013_stack_dating.sql` must be
run in the Supabase SQL Editor.** Treat it as a release gate, not a follow-up.
The app tolerates the un-migrated state — every read and write retries without
the new columns, and a pre-013 pull is marked provisional so the device's own
dating wins — so nothing BREAKS before it runs. But until it does, an existing
stack under-groups its own past: the v1→v2 device migration can only date a
stack to the day of the upgrade, and the correction it is waiting for
(`stacks.created_at`) cannot arrive over a pre-013 pull. Run the SQL, then open
the app once; the first dated pull repairs every stack.

Once 013 is applied everywhere, the pre-013 tolerance in `lib/home/stackSync.ts`
(`isUndefinedColumn` and its three retry paths, plus `provisionalStart`) is dead
code and can come out.

**The other two branches are pushed and NEITHER is merged.**

- **`wave3/fixes`** (off `wave3/progress-blocks-polish`) — the cold review's two
  HIGH fixes, the medium/low sweep, the "Discard this vial" clipping, and the
  supplement container fix. tsc / eslint / 421 tests / build all green.
- **`wave3/onboarding-flow`** (off `main`) — Spec 3-01, sixteen screens at
  `/onboarding`. tsc / eslint / 458 tests / build all green. Vercel preview is
  live but sits behind Vercel SSO, so it opens for Adrian and nobody else.

Both are waiting on Adrian's preview before anything merges.

**Branch `wave2/containers-cycles-calendar`. NOT merged, NOT pushed.**

All eleven part-two specs are built, plus Blocks (new scope), plus the em-dash
pass of part one's global sweep. **Every spec has been through an independent
review agent at least once, and the whole of part two was re-reviewed overnight
by five agents.**

Verified at the last commit: `tsc` clean, `eslint` clean, **341 tests pass**,
`next build` green, all nine `/preview/*` routes serve.

### Migrations: ALL APPLIED. Nothing pending.

`protocol/006`–`009`, `sites/011`, `blocks/001`, `protocol/010`
(`days_to_empty`), `protocol/011` (`dose_logs.logged_for`) and **`protocol/012`**
(undoes 011's bad backfill — applied by Adrian 2026-07-31).

## 🔜 DECISIONS WAITING ON ADRIAN (before anything else)

1. **Preview both branches, then say what merges.** Nothing goes to `main`
   without his word and `main` is prod.
2. **The onboarding spec's §11 token table contradicts `ui-context.md`.** The
   spec says `#060607` / `#111113` / `#26262A` / `#F3A63C`, Playfair for the
   founder letter, Caveat for the signature, and Lucide icons. `ui-context.md`
   says `#111110` / `#1C1C1A` / `#2E2E2C` / `#C8861A`, retires the display serif
   outright, and retires Lucide. **The flow was built to `ui-context.md`**,
   because the same spec names it as binding in §2 and §17. Either the spec's
   table gets corrected or `ui-context.md` does. It cannot be both.
3. **A handwritten signature ASSET for the founder letter.** The spec asks for
   Caveat; loading a fourth font for one line is the drift `ui-context.md`
   exists to stop. An SVG signature, like the wordmark already is, would be
   on-system. Needs Adrian's actual signature.
4. **Kyle the vial art.** Two poses are stubbed as designed placeholders
   (`components/onboarding/mascot.tsx`): drop files at
   `public/onboarding/kyle-flex.png` and `kyle-happy.png` and flip the two
   entries in `KYLE_ART` from null. **Kyle is a VIAL. The reference images for
   this build showed a jar; that is not him.**
5. **The gym-floor backdrop for the hook screen.** `HOOK_BACKDROP` in
   `screens/hook.tsx` is null and the screen renders on the plain canvas.
   Drop a photo in and set the constant; the one-shot settle is already wired.
6. **Pricing (D-4).** $70/yr and $9.99/mo are placeholders and render from
   `lib/onboarding/pricing.ts`. The per-week figure and the "Save 42%" badge are
   DERIVED from those two numbers, so changing the prices moves everything and
   nothing can contradict anything else.

## 🔜 THE SUPPLEMENT FORM OVERRIDE (approved, NOT built)

Adrian approved a per-user form override living on his own protocol row. **It is
not built, because it needs a migration only he can apply** (the Supabase MCP is
not authorised here) and shipping UI against a column that does not exist yet
would 42501 the preview.

The plan, when he is ready:

- `supabase/protocol/013_compound_form_override.sql` — a nullable
  `protocol_compounds.form_override text` with a CHECK of
  `('tablet','capsule','powder','liquid')`. Additive, no table count change.
- **It must also be added to BOTH grant lists** in a new `supabase/grants/00N_*`
  migration, or the Data API 42501s on every write to `protocol_compounds`
  (`code-standards.md` — this has bitten before).
- The catalogue stays read-only (Invariant 6). The override is the user's, on
  the user's row.
- `containerFormFor` already takes the compound; it gains one more optional
  input that wins over the unit rule when set.

**The default fix has already shipped on `wave3/fixes` and needs no migration**,
so vitamin C and D3 read correctly out of the box either way.

## 🔜 CARRIED FROM THE OVERNIGHT SESSION

1. **Adrian's own notes** (top of this file).
2. **The fifth re-review agent's findings.** Four of five reported overnight and
   everything they found is fixed. The fifth — the Home / add-compound /
   log-a-dose loop — was still running when the session ended. **Check for its
   report and fix what it found before anything else.** It covers the newest and
   least-reviewed code: the editable log date, the note field, and the inline
   cycle fields.
3. **"Ends when the vial runs out."** Adrian asked for this button twice. It is
   deliberately withheld behind `VIAL_END_SUPPORTED = false`
   (`lib/protocol/cycleRule.ts`) because nothing derives the day a vial actually
   ran dry, so the option would save a cycle that never ends. Making it real
   means deriving that date from dose logs + vial totals (a Postgres read) and
   threading it through **11 `isDueOnFor` / `isOnCycle` call sites in 7 files**,
   because that function is pure and synchronous and the week strip, calendar,
   consistency and Next Dose all go through it. Half-threading it produces
   exactly the Home-says-X-Progress-says-Y contradictions the reviews keep
   catching. **Its own pass, first thing, while the context is fresh.**
4. **The reconnect re-push is a round-trip storm.** Measured: 200 logged doses
   produce ~600 sequential statements and ~400 `auth.getUser()` calls on every
   `online` event, which fires on any network flap and on mobile app resume. A
   year of daily doses is ~1100 sequential requests. `upsertDoseLogs` (bulk)
   already exists; `repushDoseLogs` should batch through it.

## ✅ The authenticated cold-start walkthrough is DONE (2026-07-31)

Driven end to end against PRODUCTION Supabase on a throwaway account, in Chrome,
at 360/390/430. **All four never-executed paths work** — Blocks (the missing
`GRANT` is applied and holds), `updatePhysical`, `extendBlock`, and `startBlock`'s
compensating restore — and both CRITICAL fixes were re-measured against real rows
rather than re-read. Full detail in `progress-tracker.md`. Nine routes serve clean
at all three widths with no console or page errors.

**Merge-relevant number:** all 288 production `dose_logs` rows are recoverable
from their row id, so no user is left on the `taken_at` fallback.

Two dev-only defects were found and fixed (the photo adjust step, a React `key`
warning). One item is deliberately left for Adrian, below.

### All follow-ups FIXED (Adrian's call, same day)

The three items this walkthrough left open were then fixed and verified by
execution on a second throwaway account:

- **Blocks showed weight in kg regardless of `units_preference`.** Fixed as one
  piece across the retrospective, the live block card, the Progress banner's
  target line and the create sheet — display AND the typed target, which now
  converts to kg on save. Half of it would have been worse than none: a lbs
  reading against a kg target. The direction inference was also comparing a
  typed lbs number against a kg weigh-in, so "lose to 180 lbs" from 186.4 lbs
  read as a GAIN. Pinned by four tests in `lib/blocks/block.test.ts`.
- **Progress and Blocks never hydrated the device store they read from.** Both
  now do (`CloudHydration` for Progress's server shell, the hook directly in
  `BlocksScreen`). A cold entry straight to a retrospective read "0%" before and
  reads "100% · 1 of 1" now.
- **The empty Progress weight card had no control**; it is now the same
  affordance as the filled one.

---

## ⚠️ Known, judged, NOT fixed

- **`/progress` still fetches and signs EVERY progress photo with no `limit`.**
  Carried deliberately at Adrian's instruction. The review did not find it to be
  worse than he thought, but nothing measured the real cost either, because the
  third review agent (the cold execution pass) had not reported when this
  session wrote up.
- **The block start-date fix is still unverified on a real phone.** Desktop
  Chrome does not emit the empty change events an iOS wheel picker does. The
  onboarding date field was verified against a SIMULATED empty event
  (dispatching a native `change` with an empty value through the React value
  setter), which is the closest a desktop browser can get, and it holds. That is
  evidence, not proof.
- **The journal date fix is the same shape** and was reasoned from the code
  path, not driven on a phone. It is a strict improvement either way: it removes
  a coercion, so the worst case is that the event never fires.


These were found by review and deliberately left. Each needs a decision, not a
patch.

- **Contrast is below AA in three places, and all three are token decisions.**
  `--text-muted` on `--bg-surface` is **3.95:1** at full opacity, so every muted
  label in the app is under the 4.5:1 floor. Profile's read-state dim makes its
  row labels 3.20:1. The danger-zone red (`#b91c1c` on the page) is **2.92:1** —
  the two most consequential controls in the app are its least legible text.
  Changing any of them is a palette change and Adrian's call. `ui-context.md`.
- **The calendar's cycle colours were designed as soft fills and are now 2px
  hairlines.** Six of the twelve palette colours fall below 3:1 against the
  surface; on out-of-month days the cell's `opacity-40` drops them to ~1.4:1.
  The marks work structurally (measured: no collisions, uniform cells) but the
  quiet half of the palette is close to invisible at that size.
- **The calendar key does not describe the cycle marks.** The ⓘ sheet still
  explains only the four ring states, and the Cycles key draws a 12px circle
  where the grid now draws a 16×2 bar.
- **The bands take a cycle's CURRENT colour**, so recolouring a cycle repaints
  its history — while the pattern and end shown beside it are historical.
- **Blocks: ending early is now 4 taps** (Progress → banner → list → card → ⋯).
  That follows directly from Adrian's "tapping a block opens the look-back"
  call, and the amber end-date dot is unaffected. Flagged in case it grates.
- **Spec 09 and spec 11 files no longer match what shipped.** 09 still mandates
  the "Clear all compounds" row that was removed and says the sex change takes
  no confirmation; 11 describes a time field that does not pre-fill. Their
  checklists can never pass as written. **Say the word and they get amended** —
  otherwise a future session will "fix" the app back.
- **The Blocks empty-state copy** was deleted rather than rewritten. If the
  screen ever needs a line again, Adrian rejected both the original and the
  first proposal.

---

## PARKED — Adrian's calls, carried forward

- **A note on a dose SHIPPED** (he approved it). No migration was needed:
  `dose_logs.note` has existed since v0.4.2 and nothing had ever written to it.
- **`CompoundHeader`** is a new shared component, flagged as the specs require.
- **The two spec 08 items are settled**: fix the widget height as needed
  ("don't worry about what the spec file says"), and the journal widget stays as
  it looks now.
- **Portrait lock is done and softened** the way he asked: manifest for the
  installed PWA, and a browser fallback that waits for a sustained 1.2s of
  landscape, fades in, and can be dismissed for the session so someone who has
  locked their phone to landscape for accessibility is never walled out.
- **The timezone fix is done**: `logged_for` is written by the device at log
  time and read back, and 012 undid the bad backfill.

---

## The trap that cost the first review round most of its run

**A stale `.next` from a production build wedges `next dev`.** The server accepts
TCP, answers `/manifest.webmanifest`, then hangs forever on `○ Compiling …`. It
looks like a slow compile and never finishes. Three agents lost most of a run to
it and wrongly reported that `/preview/*` pages do not hydrate. They do.

`pkill -f "next dev" && rm -rf .next`, then restart. **Never run `next build`
against the same `.next` as a running dev server** — and tell every review agent
the same, because two of them did it anyway.

---

## KNOWN GAPS, carried deliberately

**Cycle end condition 3 is WITHHELD** — see item 3 above.

**Injection sites are not captured when a stack is logged in one tap.**

**No component tests.** Vitest covers `lib/**` only (pure, by house rule). Every
critical found in this wave came from executing the real screen in Chrome, not
from the suite. 341 tests pass and would not have caught any of them.

---

## Decisions Adrian has SETTLED - do not re-litigate

- Week strip: soft raised block for the selected day, status dot INSIDE it.
- Today card dot cap: 9, then "+N". Cycle countdown-vs-date crossover: 14 days.
- Schedule: rows of dots, NOT a table. Unnamed stacks auto-name "Stack N".
- Compound detail sheet leads with the CONTAINER; specs 10 and 11 reuse it.
- Tapping a block opens its look-back; end/extend live behind the ⋯ on that page.
- Cycles annotate the calendar as a thin rule under the date, never a fill.
- "Cycle this" expands INLINE in the add form, with every variable on it.
- The log sheet's date is editable, and changing it MOVES the dose.
- The danger zone is two plain rows. "Clear all compounds & stock" is gone.
- **NO EM DASHES in any user-facing string.**
- Health data is categorical, never evaluative.

---

## Merging, when Adrian says so

`main` deploys straight to Vercel prod, so merge ONLY on his word. Before it:
tsc, lint, `npm test` and `next build` all clean; decide whether the `/preview/*`
demo pages ship; do not rewrite the migration files.
