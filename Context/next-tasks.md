# Next Tasks

The **windscreen** — detailed, actionable steps for what to do next. This is the
*only* file that says "what to do next"; `progress-tracker.md` records what's
already done.

**How we use this file:** when a task is finished, (1) log it in
`progress-tracker.md`, (2) tick or delete it here, and (3) add the next concrete
steps. Keep it focused on the current + immediately-upcoming work — the full
long-range roadmap doesn't belong here.

## 🎯 Current focus

Auth + the logged-in shell are **✅ live on https://trackdco.app** (Google sign-in
→ 18+/ToS gate → dashboard, branded PWA splash, RLS verified with two accounts —
Week-1 checkpoint met). Now **two parallel app-UI lanes**, both via the PR flow
(branch → PR → CodeRabbit → merge):
- **Adrian — core loop** (`feat/app-ui`): cycles → compounds → inventory → dose
  logging → reflow. The week-2 spine.
- **Angus + Claude — Profile & Settings** (`feat/settings`): `/settings` v1 built,
  **PR #2 in CodeRabbit review**. Self-contained (own folders, own profile row).
  Angus also owns **beta outreach** + the business setup (Airwallex → Pro + custom
  domain). One follow-up: nav link to `/settings` in the shared `(app)/layout.tsx`
  — coordinate with Adrian.
- **Still open (Angus, quick):** publish the Google OAuth app (Audience → Publish)
  before non-Test-user testers.

---

## 🔀 Working in parallel (two builders, one repo)

Conflicts come from editing the **same files**, not from working at the same time:
- **One branch per person** — `feat/auth` (Angus), `feat/app-ui` (Adrian). Never
  commit straight to `main`.
- **Code lands via PR, not direct push (decided 2026-06-08).** Branch → push →
  **open a PR to `main`** → **CodeRabbit auto-reviews** → address findings →
  merge. CodeRabbit only reviews PRs, so anything pushed straight to `main` gets
  no review. Merging a PR to `main` = a Vercel **prod** deploy. (Trivial
  `Context/*.md` doc-only edits may still go direct for speed.)
- **`git pull` before you start and before you push;** merge one lane at a time,
  the other pulls right after.
- **Stay in your folders.** Shared foundations (`app/globals.css`, `app/layout.tsx`,
  `components/ui/**`, the Context docs) change only by agreement — route them
  through one person.
- **Auth + the app shell land first** — they build the logged-in layout every
  feature screen sits in, so Adrian's screens branch off cleanly once it exists.
- Build everything against the **locked design system** (`ui-context.md`).

## 🛠️ Build track — Angus + Claude

### ✅ DONE — Apply the schema (build the data model)

Applied 2026-06-06 as two tracked migrations via the Supabase MCP:
`20260606042525_schema_v0_4_2` then `20260606042547_storage_policies_v0_4_2`.
Verified: 16 tables + 2 views (`security_invoker`), RLS on every table, private
`bloodwork` bucket + 4 owner-scoped storage policies, 16 enums, 7 functions,
signup/prefs/updated_at/unit-family triggers all present. No errors. Full record
in `progress-tracker.md`.

### ✅ DONE — Supabase client layer (2026-06-06)

Keys captured, deps installed (`@supabase/ssr` + `@supabase/supabase-js`),
`.env.local` (git-ignored) created with the real URL + **publishable key**, and
`.env.example` committed. Client files written and `npm run build` verified:
- `lib/supabase/client.ts` — browser client
- `lib/supabase/server.ts` — server client (async `cookies()` + write guard)
- `lib/supabase/middleware.ts` — `updateSession` (refresh-only, `getClaims()`)
- `proxy.ts` — Next 16's renamed-from-middleware root hook (build shows
  `ƒ Proxy (Middleware)`, no deprecation warning)

Env var names locked: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`,
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, and (later, server-only)
`SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`. The `sb_secret_` key isn't provisioned yet — only needed
for admin/seeding work, added when we get there.

### ✅ DONE — Deployed to Vercel (2026-06-06)

Committed + pushed to `main`; Vercel account created (GitHub signup — both
founders on travel data eSIMs, so phone SMS verification needed a workaround);
project imported with `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` +
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` set; deploy succeeded on the
`*.vercel.app` URL (per Angus).

### ✅ DONE — Deploy confirmed serving (2026-06-06)

Live and verified at **https://trackd-co-app.vercel.app/** (HTTP 200, renders the
"Trackd co" page; proxy session-refresh runs clean). First deploy 500'd because
the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*` env vars weren't set at build time; fixed by adding
both to the **Production** env var scope (non-sensitive) **and redeploying with
"Use existing Build Cache" UN-ticked** — a plain redeploy reused stale compiled
output where the vars were still undefined.

> ⚠️ **Gotcha banked:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_` vars are inlined at **build time**.
> Changing one means redeploy **without build cache**, or it won't take.

### ✅ DONE — Domain live (2026-06-06)

**App is live at https://trackdco.app** — verified from outside Vercel: DNS
resolves (`trackdco.app` → A `216.198.79.1`), HTTPS returns 200 with valid SSL,
and the page renders. Vercel shows "Valid Configuration".

Decision: the app is served on the **bare root `trackdco.app`**, not a subdomain
(Angus's call — the app *is* the domain; no separate marketing site for now). In
the Vercel Add-Domain dialog the "Redirect apex domains to www" option was left
OFF. Apex can't use a CNAME, so DNS at **Porkbun** is an **A record** (host blank
→ `216.198.79.1`, the IP Vercel displayed). Porkbun's two parking records (ALIAS +
wildcard CNAME → `pixie.porkbun.com`) were deleted; the Google Workspace **MX +
TXT** records were left untouched. End state: 3 records (A + MX + TXT).
- ✅ Checkpoint HIT (target 7 Jun, done 6 Jun): Supabase live, schema applied,
  deploy proven, custom domain live with SSL.

### ✅ DONE — Public landing live (2026-06-06)

App-style **First Run** onboarding shipped to https://trackdco.app (merged
`feat/landing` → `main`; verified HTTP 200 on the live domain). Mobile-first
swipeable carousel (hero → stack → site rotation → inventory) with product
mini-mocks, gold accents, a 2s auto-advance tour (snap-toggle so it works on iOS),
scroll parallax, and a "Continue with Google" CTA. Desktop shows an "open on your
phone" gate (mobile-only by intent). On-brand `/login` + `/terms` + `/privacy`
placeholders so nothing 404s. Decisions: amber used as a restrained accent across
the onboarding surface (founder call — the in-app health-data categorical/
never-evaluative invariant still stands); the proxy now **fails open** if Supabase
env is unset (a missing var can't 500 the whole site). **Feature mini-mocks are
placeholders** — swap to the real screens once the app UI is designed.

### ✅ DONE — Auth + app shell built & deployed (2026-06-08)

Built on `feat/auth`, merged to `main`, **live on https://trackdco.app** (verified
in prod). Shipped: ✅ Continue-with-Google (`signInWithOAuth`, PKCE), ✅
`/auth/callback` code exchange, ✅ real `/login`, ✅ the 18+/ToS gate at `/welcome`
(DOB via Day/Month/Year dropdowns; server-side age ≥18; one consent covering all
three docs; writes `date_of_birth`/`is_18_plus`/`tos_accepted_at`/`tos_version`),
✅ guarded `(app)` shell + empty `/dashboard` + sign-out, ✅ root redirect, ✅ PWA
install prompt + manifest, ✅ legal docs rendered from the DB at
`/terms`·`/privacy`·`/medical-disclaimer`, ✅ the `api_role_grants` migration (the
Data API had no table grants). Google OAuth dashboard set up (Angus). Proven
end-to-end with a real account: sign-in → `handle_new_user` trigger → gate writes →
dashboard; sign-out + returning-user (skips gate) both confirmed. Full record in
`progress-tracker.md`.

### ▶ NOW — Finish the auth checkpoint (Angus)

The flow is live; these three close the 11 Jun checkpoint:

1. **On-phone test** — open https://trackdco.app on **both founders' phones**, sign
   in with a **Test-user** Google account, pass the gate, land on the dashboard,
   then **Add to Home Screen** and confirm the PWA installs with the Trackd icon
   and opens full-screen.
2. **Two-account RLS isolation** — sign in with the **second** founder account and
   confirm it sees none of the first's data. Claude verifies with DB queries (check
   the **views + storage bucket** too, not just base tables). Matters most once real
   cycle/dose data exists, but baseline-check it now.
3. **Publish the Google OAuth app** — Google Cloud → **Audience → Publish App**
   (moves it out of "Testing", where only listed Test users can sign in) **and** add
   the co-founder's Google account as a Test user meanwhile. Do this before handing
   the app to beta testers.
   - ✅ Checkpoint (target 11 Jun): full flow works on both founders' phones.

### Housekeeping — fix the flaky local repo (recommended)

The local working copy at `~/Documents/GitHub/trackd-co-app` throws git
`mmap`/stale-NFS errors on heavy ops (iCloud-synced Documents); the auth merge had
to be done in a `/tmp` clone and pushed from there. Permanent fix: move the repo
out of `~/Documents` (e.g. `~/dev/trackd-co-app`) and resync to `main`. Until then
the local copy is behind GitHub — `git checkout main && git pull` once the FS
cooperates. (Claude can do the move + resync on request.)

### Also (Angus) — beta outreach (alongside the build)

Angus owns tester recruitment — his audience (100k social following + a 700-member
peptide Discord), prioritising **influencers** for reach + credibility. Targeted at
the **last few days** before 28 Jun; full strategy in a dedicated session.

### Tooling — Vercel plugin installed (2026-06-06)

Official Vercel plugin for coding agents installed at user scope
(`npx plugins add vercel/vercel-plugin --target claude-code`; Bun installed to
`~/.bun` as its prerequisite). `vercel-plugin@vercel` v0.43.0 — 26 skills, 3
specialist agents (incl. `deployment-expert`), `/vercel-plugin:*` commands, an
MCP server, and hooks. **Loads on next Claude Code session restart.** The
bundled MCP/CLI will need Vercel auth when we first use the deploy commands
(`/vercel-plugin:bootstrap` handles linking + auth).

## 🎨 Adrian's lane — legal, then app UI (design → build)

### ✅ DONE — Seed catalogues compiled + loaded (2026-06-06)

Adrian built the Compounds, Biomarkers, and IGF-1 reference-range CSVs; Claude
applied them to the live DB (149 compounds, 41 biomarkers, 4 IGF-1 ranges) as two
tracked migrations, with Adrian-approved schema deltas (enum extensions for
`sarm`/`thyroid`/`stimulant`/`g`; new `reference_ranges` table). CSVs + generator
live in `supabase/seed/`. Full record in `progress-tracker.md`.

### ✅ DONE — Markers seed catalogue loaded (2026-06-08)

The **third** catalogue (`markers` — subjective daily tracking: energy, libido,
sleep, pumps, mood… plus side-effects as negative-polarity markers) is now
**built and loaded**. Adrian supplied the CSV; Claude added it as
`supabase/seed/markers.csv` (36 markers), extended `build-seed-sql.mjs`
(pipe-split `tier_labels` → `text[]`, `TRUE`/`FALSE` → boolean), regenerated
`002_seed_catalogues.sql`, and applied the `seed_markers` tracked migration. No
schema/enum change needed (`marker_polarity` already covered the values). Verified
accessible exactly like compounds/biomarkers: 36 rows, RLS on, single
read-only-to-authed SELECT policy, no write policy. Full record in
`progress-tracker.md`. The catalogue is ready for the journal + markers UI to read.

### ✅ DONE — Legal / disclaimer copy drafted + stored (2026-06-06)

Terms of Service (v0.2), Privacy Policy (v0.1), and Medical Disclaimer (v0.2)
drafted and **stored in the DB** in the new `legal_documents` table (SQL in
`supabase/legal/`; verbatim, encoding cleaned, Privacy Policy NOTE blocks kept).
Store-only — NOT wired into signup. Full record in `progress-tracker.md`; the
versioning/dating rule is in `architecture.md` → "Legal Documents".

**Still open (parked until Adrian directs — see `progress-tracker.md` Open
Questions):** (1) §7 backup-retention window to confirm + the two retention facts
to state in-body; (2) §9 "comply with the user's regional law" clause; (3) §5/§10
name the Supabase + Vercel regions.

### ⏭ AT LAUNCH — Legal docs: bump to v1.0 + freeze the effective date

Do this **on launch day**, before/with going live (rule in `architecture.md`):
1. Set each document's `version` to **`1.0`** and `is_beta = false`.
2. Set `effective_date` **and** the in-body header line to the **actual launch
   date** (replace "DD Month 2026 — set on launch"). This date is then frozen.
3. Rename the source files in `supabase/legal/` to `…-v1.0` and drop "beta".
4. Thereafter: any change to a doc → bump a **whole** version (2.0, 3.0…),
   re-date it, flip the old row `is_current = false`, delete the superseded
   source file. Wire the signup acceptance UI only when separately directed.

## 🗂️ Backlog (not yet scheduled — pull up here when the above is done)

- **Week 2+ build:** add-compound + inventory → dose logging → the daily-use loop
  (core-loop order in `ai-workflow-rules.md`) — Adrian's `feat/app-ui` lane once
  the shell's up.
- **Pre-public-beta — brand the OAuth domain + check region (after Airwallex/Pro).**
  The Google sign-in screen shows the raw `…supabase.co` host — fix with a Supabase
  **Custom Domain** (e.g. `auth.trackdco.app`) so it reads as Trackd. Needs Supabase
  **Pro ($25/mo) + Custom Domain add-on ($10/mo)**. Angus does the subscription after
  setting up the Airwallex business account, then Claude drives the domain setup
  (CNAME + TXT verify, add the new callback to Google, activate via CLI). Same pass:
  **check the project region** (Settings → Infrastructure) and relocate if it's far
  from the AU audience (do it while user data is minimal). Details in memory
  `launch-custom-domain-and-region`.
