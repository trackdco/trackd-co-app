/**
 * Home ⇄ Postgres adapter (Protocol Cutover, Step 3). The Home flip keeps the
 * existing device-local store APIs (`lib/home/stack.ts`, `doseLog.ts`) and their
 * `StackCompound` / `DayLogs` shapes unchanged — these server actions are what
 * those stores now ALSO read from / write to, making Postgres the source of truth
 * while localStorage stays the instant offline cache.
 *
 * All catalogue resolution (name ⇄ `compounds.id`) and id handling live HERE,
 * server-side, so there is ONE implementation:
 *  - `protocol_compounds.id` = the client `StackCompound.id` when that is a valid
 *    uuid (the common case — `crypto.randomUUID()`); otherwise a deterministic
 *    uuid hashed from it (the insecure-context `s_…`/`c_…` fallback ids). Either
 *    way the mapping is stable, so re-runs and the Step 2 migration upsert the
 *    SAME rows (idempotent) and the local store + Postgres stay joined by id.
 *  - A compound whose name doesn't resolve in the read-only catalogue is a custom
 *    "Make your own" compound (v1.5) — these writes no-op (`skipped`) so customs
 *    stay device-local; their dose-log writes find no `protocol_compound` and are
 *    skipped without error.
 *
 * Identity is always from the verified session; RLS the backstop; never the
 * service role (house pattern). Everything is best-effort and never throws — the
 * synchronous localStorage write has already succeeded; Postgres is the durable
 * source, not the read path, so a network blip can't break Home.
